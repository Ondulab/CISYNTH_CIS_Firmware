        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The CISYNTH is an innovative tangible interface for creating music and visuals. Utilizing our CIS instrument, the CISYNTH produces a UDP stream of thousands of values captured by contact image sensor, transmitted at a frequency up to 1000 Hz. This stream can be used to generate music or display image stream in Max/MSP, Pure Data, and our Viewer.</p>
